This is a personal project that was spun off a CodeClan homework assignment to import an API. I realised that there was quite a lot of data to play with and multiple API calls that could interact with each other so decided to use the data to practice working with an API, React, CSS and Javascript. 

Plus, I really like Bob's Burgers.
